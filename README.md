# Introduction

Passionate about investing and understanding how businesses work. Started investing 4 years ago, during this time I've cultivated valuable insights on what makes businesses succeed. This includes understanding the nature of competitive advantages and business strategy. As well as developing an analtica framework for making data-driven decisions.

In this repository you can find a sample of valuations I am proud of.
